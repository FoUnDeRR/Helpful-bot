# Creation 

*Helpful is made out in 2021, June Helpful's owner is FoUnDeR. Who is a sri lankan. The third bot which is released from sri lanka. If we talking about commands, Yes ofcourse. Helpful bot mediumly has basics commands that will be useful for discord servers. Which is why, I started to create helpful bot with python. The bot is ugly when the first time. After that, @FoUnDeRR created a custom help command by himself.*

# Language

*Yeah, i am using python for develop helpful. Firstly i didn't knew about python so well. After all, I was excited about python. And also, i was brings a bot online with javascript. But i didn't go through JavaScript to create commands. And some days later, I started to make my own customization bot with Python. It is a easy language if the person knows Python. For beginners that won't be easy though. Now i'm Advicing you, that if you wanna make your own bot with python, first, learn it.*
