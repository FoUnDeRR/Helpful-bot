Having issues with error handling commands? Well you can learn it from here. In here you can see the code with instructions.

The basic command for error handling;

@removerole.error
async def removerole_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.MissingPermissions):
        await ctx.send("")
 
This is how you exactly make a error handler. This is not that hard. You can enter any names onto @removerole.error.
Examples:
@changeprefix.error
async def changeprefix_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.MissingPermissions):
        await ctx.send("In this blank, you can add anything you want.")

Example:
await ctx.send("Hold up hold up! You're missing Administrator Permissions")


If you made a mute command and wanted to add error handler, well no problem!
Follow below instructions. Follow step-by-step.

1) Add a syntax name into your error blank.
   Example: @mute.error
   
2) async the error what you want to make.
   Example: async def mute_error(ctx, error):   (after async def, it must be like mute_error. not mute.error)
   
3) You must make isinstance Missing Permissions.
   Example: if isinstance(error, commands.MissingPermissions):
   
4) Well you came to final step. This is not that hard like i said. You've to add sending text when someone typed <your bot prefix>mute.
   Example: await ctx.send("Missing Manage Messages Permissions")
   
So this is how you make a error handling code.
Wait, still confused about it? No worries! here's the full code what you need.


@mute.error
async def mute_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.MissingPermissions):
        await ctx.send("Missing Manage Messages Permissions")
        
You can change await ctx.send("This blank") anytime you want. That will display in text channel after someone uses mute command.
And if you're making something other error handler, for example: kick error handler, you can change mute_error to kick_error. and also @mute.error to @kick.error
